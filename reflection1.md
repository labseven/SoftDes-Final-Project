## Reflection
# Things we need to think about:
- Scoping
 - Keep checking in with our progress and see how reachable our scope is.
 - Neural nets may be out of scope.
   - We need to try it and see if we can use it
- Interactivity
  - It was suggested to add interactivity for fun and profit


# New Questions:
- What kind of ML do we want to use?
- How much can we abstract the physics?


# Review process reflection
- We could have had more diverse questions to ask ones the people could answer (Ours were limited to ml and physics)
