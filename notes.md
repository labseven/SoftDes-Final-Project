neural network overkill?  
find easier ML algorithm  
2 sort of project: physics of car on track and the drawing the track etc  
make sure scoping is right  
weighting things, grass is less, checkpoint more  
checks for positive and negative direction: Gradient Maps  
Weighting gets a lot higher the further you go  
Ghosts of AI race, yay, that's cool  
Start off training on circular map  
Show a bunch of iterations next to each other, just trace path, not how it  
Just abstract the physics out  
Doesn't need to be exactly precise  
Just add drift coefficient?  
pygame physics engine!  
Cheat on starting, easier part, delve deeper into ML  
MVP vs stretch goal for physics, figure that out  
obstacles as a very stretch goal
