## What does it do?
Corn RacEAR is, at its lowest level, a car simulator game. There are two choices of gameplay. You can choose to either draw a track and drive around the track manually or have the car drive around autonomously. For autonomous drive, you can choose to watch the car drive around a pre-driven track or can draw a track and watch the car learn how to drive around it.
